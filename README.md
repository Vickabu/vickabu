## Hi, I'm Vicktoria! 👋
Welcome To my GitHub profile! 

## 🌱 About Me
Hi! I'm a creative frontend developer who loves building nice-looking and easy-to-use websites.
I'm currently a student at Noroff, learning all about web design and development — and having a lot of fun with it!

**Creative soul:**
I’m into painting, drawing, sculpting, crocheting — anything where I can make something with my hands. Always up for trying something new.

**Big music addict:**
There’s always music playing around me. It helps me focus, lifts my mood, and keeps me inspired.

**Animal Advocate:**
I genuinely believe animals make life better. They bring so much joy and calm to the world.
